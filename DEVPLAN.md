# DEVPLAN

## PR Non-Negotiable
**Every PR must update DEVPLAN.md. Missing that update is a serious PR mistake.**
**During every PR, we must explicitly review what has been completed, reassess whether the current plan is still optimal, tighten or simplify the implementation plan where needed, and refresh the future roadmap before merging.**

## Process Rule
**Every PR must update DEVPLAN.md to reflect completed work, current status, and next steps.**

## Objective
Build a broker-agnostic, read-only IBKR integration layer for market monitoring and portfolio analytics, with IBKR Client Portal Web API as the primary path and clean extension points for future providers/services. The immediate delivery path is a reliable position-report workflow that can run from normalized snapshots, raw IBKR payloads, and live local TWS / IB Gateway sessions.

## In Scope
- Read-only provider adapters for:
  - Client Portal Web API (primary, custom wrapper)
  - TWS / IB Gateway via `ib_async` (thin wrapper only)
  - Flex Web Service (archival/reconciliation)
- Domain normalization before business logic.
- Allocation/risk/reporting services built on broker-agnostic models.
- Static HTML monitor output (non-interactive V1).

## Out of Scope
- Any order placement/cancel/modify capability in V1.
- Raw TWS socket client implementation.
- Full interactive frontend app in this phase.

## Completed
- Phase 0 guardrail docs added (`requirements`, `read_only_policy`, `provider_matrix`).
- Foundation utilities/config loading with strict read-only mode validation.
- Domain models added: account/contract/position/quote/allocation/risk/monitor view.
- Provider base protocols and fake provider test seam added.
- Runtime read-only guards added in `safety/read_only_guards.py`.
- Web API skeleton client added with read-only guard checks.
- Web API mapping utilities added for account summary, positions, and quote snapshots.
- Generic retry helper (`with_retry`) added for transient Web API operations.
- Web API session/auth + account-summary/positions/snapshot wrappers added with injectable transport seams.
- Config fields and setup docs added for IBKR username/password vs OAuth consumer-key usage.
- Local position-report CSV path added for normalized snapshots.
- Raw IBKR payload to CSV workflow added, including CLI support for direct report generation from IBKR JSON dumps.
- Live local Client Portal Gateway to CSV workflow added for authenticated read-only IBKR sessions.
- Executable `scripts/run_report.sh` wrapper added for snapshot, raw-IBKR, and live report runs.
- Live report path switched to TWS / IB Gateway via `ib_async`, including a thin adapter and portfolio-to-report mappers.
- Script-level live-account defaults moved to local gitignored config, with explicit `--account` override support.
- Report CSV now includes instrument metadata columns such as `con_id`, `symbol`, `local_symbol`, `exchange`, and `currency`.
- Unit tests added and expanded across config, domain, providers, portfolio normalization, reporting, workflows, and read-only guard behavior.

## In Progress
- Tightening the live TWS / `ib_async` report path with better account metadata, richer report fields, stronger session ergonomics, and eventual broader provider coverage.

## Next Steps
1. Add clearer connection diagnostics and account-selection ergonomics for live TWS / IB Gateway runs.
2. Add HTML report rendering once CSV output is stable.
3. Add fixture sets from real IBKR payloads to harden compatibility.
4. Optionally add a broader Client Portal Web API wrapper layer if we need more endpoints beyond position reporting.

## Backlog / Future Phases
- Implement TWS thin adapters via `ib_async` (`client`, `portfolio`, `market_data`, `mapper`).
- Implement Flex fetch/parse/map archival flow.
- Build broker-agnostic business services (portfolio/quote/allocation/risk/monitor).
- Build HTML monitor rendering and snapshot tests.
- Add e2e workflow coverage across Web API, TWS, and Flex.

## Risks / Blockers / Assumptions
- IBKR payload/field variability (especially market-data field codes) requires robust fixtures.
- Session/auth behavior may vary by account configuration and runtime environment.
- Existing legacy modules and new provider layer will coexist temporarily during migration.
- Read-only policy must remain explicit in config + runtime guards to avoid accidental drift.
- Initial report output favors correctness and inspectability over presentation polish.

## Testing Status
- Unit-test command passes under `py313`: `conda run -n py313 python -m pytest -q tests/unit`

## Notes
- Execution/trading support remains intentionally unimplemented.
- Plan remains incremental; unrelated repo areas were not refactored.
